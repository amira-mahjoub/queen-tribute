		<h2 id="discography">Discography </h2>

		<p>British rock band Queen consisted of vocalist Freddie Mercury (d. 1991), guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bassist John Deacon (r. 1997). Founded in 1970, Queen released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Despite not being an immediate success, Queen gained popularity in Britain with their second album Queen II in 1974. Their 1975 song, "Bohemian Rhapsody", was number 1 for nine weeks (and a further five weeks in 1991) and is the third biggest selling single of all time in the UK. In the US, "Bohemian Rhapsody" hit the Billboard Top 40 charts in three different decades, reaching number 9 in its original 1975 release, number 2 in 1992 after being featured in the film Wayne's World, and hitting the top 40 once more in 2018 upon the release of the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. The band's 1981 Greatest Hits album is the biggest selling album in UK history with 6.0 million copies sold by 2014. The band's 1991 compilation Greatest Hits II is also one of the UK's top ten biggest sellers of all time, with 3.8 million copies sold by 2012.

		In 1972, Queen signed a production deal with Trident Studios. Later in their career, Queen signed a record contract with EMI, and Elektra in the United States. The band would remain with EMI for the rest of their career, though, in 1983, they terminated their American contract with Elektra and signed with Capitol Records. However in 1990, they terminated their US contract with Capitol and signed with Disney's Hollywood Records, which has remained the current owner and distributor of Queen's entire music catalogue in North America.

		In 1991, Queen's entire catalogue was remastered and released by Hollywood on CD in the United States, and thirteen albums (all studio albums up to The Works as well as Live Killers and Greatest Hits) were remastered at Abbey Road Studios and released on CD and cassette in the United Kingdom between July 1993 and March 1994. Queen's entire album back catalogue was remastered and re-released in the UK and rest of the world (excluding the US) through 2011 to commemorate their 40th anniversary (as well as being the 20th anniversary of Mercury's death). The 2011 remasters were released by Universal's Island Records label, as the band's contract with EMI Records ended in 2010. The 2011 remasters were released on SACD by Universal Music Japan, between November 2011 and April 2012. In an interview with BBC Wales, Brian May announced a new compilation album titled Queen Forever, which was later released by Hollywood in November 2014. </p>

		<h2>Music style and influences</h2>

		<p>Queen drew artistic influence from British rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s, such as the Beatles, the Kinks, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Who, Black Sabbath, Slade, Deep Purple, David Bowie, Genesis and Yes,[254] in addition to American guitarist Jimi Hendrix,[255] with Mercury also inspired by the gospel singer Aretha Franklin.[256] May referred to the Beatles as being "our bible in the way they used the studio and they painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of harmonies."[257] At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as "Led Zeppelin meets Yes" due to its combination of "acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics".[258] In his book on Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, Eddie Trunk described Queen as "a hard rock band at the core but one with a high level of majesty and theatricality that delivered a little something for everyone", as well as observing that the band "sounded British".[259]

		Queen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music, often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude.[260] The music styles and genres they have been associated with include progressive rock (also known as symphonic rock),[261][262][263] art rock,[21][264] glam rock,[261] arena rock,[261] heavy metal,[261] pop rock,[261] psychedelic rock,[265] baroque pop,[266] and rockabilly.[266] Queen also wrote songs that were inspired by diverse musical styles which are not typically associated with rock groups, such as opera,[267] music hall,[267] folk music,[268] gospel,[269] ragtime,[270] and dance/disco.[271] Their 1980 single "Another One Bites the Dust" became a major hit single in the funk rock genre.[272] Several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions".[273][274] Similarly, "Radio Ga Ga" became a live favourite because it would have "crowds clapping like they were at a Nuremberg rally".[275]

		In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback.[276][277] May has used Vox AC30 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with his long-time hero Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 1960s/early 1970s.[278] Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to the producer Roy Thomas Baker and engineer Mike Stone.[279][280] Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in "Bohemian Rhapsody".[281] The band's vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys,[264][282] but May stated they were not "much of an influence".[257]

		Directed by Bruce Gowers, the groundbreaking “Bohemian Rhapsody” promotional video sees the band adopt a “decadent 'glam' sensibility". Replicating Mick Rock’s photograph of the band from the cover of Queen II – which itself was inspired by a photo of actress Marlene Dietrich from Shanghai Express (1932) – the video opens with "Queen standing in diamond formation, heads tilted back like Easter Island statues" in near darkness as they sing the a cappella part.[283] David Mallet directed a number of their subsequent music videos, some of which use footage from classic films: "Under Pressure" incorporates 1920s silent films, Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu, the 1984 video for "Radio Ga Ga" includes footage from Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), while the 1995 video "Heaven for Everyone" shows footage from Georges Méliès' A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904).[284] The first part of Mallet's music video for "I Want to Break Free" spoofed the popular long-running British soap opera Coronation Street.[285] The music video for "Innuendo" combines stop motion animation with rotoscoping and band members appear as illustrations and images taken from earlier Queen music videos on a cinema screen in the same manner as in the British film Nineteen Eighty-Four.[286]</p>

		<h2>Legacy</h2>

		<p>In 2002, Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" was voted "the UK's favourite hit of all time" in a poll conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book.[287] In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[288] Many scholars consider the "Bohemian Rhapsody" music video ground-breaking, crediting it with popularising the medium.[54][55] Rock historian Paul Fowles stated that the song is "widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy".[289] It has been hailed as launching the MTV age.[290] In December 2018, "Bohemian Rhapsody" became the most-streamed song from the 20th century, and the most-streamed classic rock song of all time.[291] The number of downloads of the song and original video exceeded 1.6 billion across global on-demand streaming services.[292] Acclaimed for their stadium rock, in 2005 an industry poll ranked Queen's performance at Live Aid in 1985 as the best live act in history.[273][293] In 2007, they were also voted the greatest British band in history by BBC Radio 2 listeners.[294]

		If you have to go back and watch one performance it has to be Queen. That was not just a career-defining moment ... rock 'n' roll might have peaked right there. Freddie Mercury on stage at Live Aid is the summit of rock 'n' roll. For a band some people said was washed up, that was just the most stunning, breathtaking, flawless, powerful, jubilant performance. It was everything you want in rock 'n' roll.

		As of 2005, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, Queen albums have spent a total of 1,322 weeks (twenty-six years) on the UK Album Charts, more time than any other act.[99] Also in 2005, with the release of their live album with Paul Rodgers, Queen moved into third place on the list of acts with the most aggregate time spent on the British record charts.[296] In 2006, the Greatest Hits album was the all-time best-selling album in UK Chart history, with sales of 5,407,587 copies, over 604,295 more copies than its nearest competitor, the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.[100] Their Greatest Hits II album is the tenth best seller, with sales of 3,746,404 copies.[159][297]

		The band have released a total of eighteen number one albums, eighteen number one singles, and ten number one DVDs worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. Queen have sold over 170 million records, with some estimates in excess of 300 million records worldwide,[273][298][299][300][301] including 34.5 million albums in the US as of 2004.[302] Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the band is the only group in which every member has composed more than one chart-topping single, and all four members were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003.[303][304] In 2009, "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions" were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame,[305][306] and the latter was voted the world's favourite song in a 2005 Sony Ericsson global music poll.[307] The band received Ivor Novello Awards for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, in 1987, and Outstanding Song Collection, in 2005, from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[308][309] In 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[310]

		Queen are one of the most bootlegged bands ever, according to Nick Weymouth, who manages the band's official website.[311] A 2001 survey discovered the existence of 12,225 websites dedicated to Queen bootlegs, the highest number for any band.[312] Bootleg recordings have contributed to the band's popularity in certain countries where Western music is censored, such as Iran.[313] In a project called Queen: The Top 100 Bootlegs, many of these have been made officially available to download for a nominal fee from Queen's website, with profits going to the Mercury Phoenix Trust.[311] Rolling Stone ranked Queen at number 52 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time",[314] while ranking Mercury the 18th greatest singer,[158] and May the twenty-sixth greatest guitarist.[315] Rolling Stone readers voted Mercury the second greatest frontman.[316] Queen were named 13th on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list,[317] and in 2010 were ranked 17th on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.[318] In 2012, Gigwise readers named Queen the best band of the past 60 years.[319] Eddie Trunk argued that Queen's importance, in common with Thin Lizzy and Deep Purple, was "not as fully recognized" in the United States because elsewhere they "often played to much bigger crowds in stadium venues".[259] Queen had stopped touring the US in 1982 as their success there had started to wane, but they remained a touring "juggernaut", filling stadiums and arenas internationally in the 1980s until their final tour (with Mercury) in 1986.[266]</p>

		<h2>Tours</h2>

		<p>The English rock band Queen was well known for its diverse music style .queen was catalogues, large sound systems, lighting rigs, innovative pyrotechnics and extravagant costumes often gave shows a theatrical nature. Artists such as Bob Geldof, George Michael, David Bowie, Kurt Cobain (in his suicide note), and Robbie Williams have expressed admiration for lead singer Freddie Mercury's stage presence.{{ |date=October 2007}}

		Queen wrote certain songs, such as "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", with the goal of audience participation. "Radio Ga Ga" came to inspire synchronized hand-clapping (this routine, originating from the song's video, was the invention of the video's director, David Mallet). This influenced Queen's appearance at Live Aid, where the 72,000-person crowd at Wembley Stadium would often sing loudly and clap their hands in unison. Queen's performance at Live Aid was later voted the greatest live show of all time by a large selection of musicians and critics .[1]</p>
